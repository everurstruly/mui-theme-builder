### Why

The existing MUI theme editors work, but they're not great to look at or use. I wanted something more minimal,visually appealing and accessible, that actually lets you build themes for both light and dark mode properly.

This isn't a ground-up rewrite — I've reused code from existing projects (shout out to the links below), but focused on improving:

- **UX:** Cleaner interface, less clutter  
- **iOS Support:** Added an iOS preset because why not  
- **Dark Mode:** Actually works properly for both light and dark themes  
- **Visual Design:** It doesn't look like shit
