A visual editor for customizing MUI components with Material and iOS design.

### Why

The existing MUI theme editors works to some degree, but they're not great to look at or use. I wanted something more intuitive, appealing and accessible, which also lets you theme for both light and dark mode properly.

This isn't a ground-up rewrite persay, as I plan reused code from the existing version, but focused on improving:

- **UX:** Cleaner interface, less clutter  
- **iOS Support:** Added an iOS preset (not liquid glass!)  
- **Dark Mode:** Actually works properly for both light and dark themes  
- **Visual Design:** It doesn't look like low effor cooperate sh*it



### Thanks To

- Tweakcn, Zenoo, AntDesign and Figma

This started as a potential PR to existing projects, but my vision differed enough that it made sense to build it separately.
