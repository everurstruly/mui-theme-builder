# MUI Theme Builder 

A modern visual & code editor for customizing MUI themes. 

## Why This Exists

Existing MUI theme builders are well-built and functional, but there were a few gaps I wanted to fill.

This isn't about replacing what's out there - those projects are solid, senior-level work with great docs and optimization. This is about exploring a different approach to the same problem.

What nakes this different?


### 1. Simultaneous Light & Dark Mode

Design and preview both color schemes side-by-side

### 2. Export Flexibility

- **ThemeOptions only** or **full Theme object**
- **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, or **JSON**
- Clean, copy-paste ready code


### 3. Code Editor Integration

Direct access to the theme object. Write custom overrides in TypeScript with full autocomplete, doc and diff view. No more guessing at deeply nested paths.


### 4. Design Presets You'd Love. 

Material Design, Minimalism, IOS Designs and more **(Submission are encouraged via pull request)**


### 5. Modern, Intuitive Interfacs. 

Prove that MUI can be used to build elegant apps and tools, not just boring enterprise dashboards.


## Credits & Inspiration

This editor's design was inspired by:
- **Material Builder Plugin & MUI Theme Creator** - Code optimization inspiration and more 
- **Tweakcn Shadcn/ui** - Made me realize I like to prototype themes remotely and visually
- **Figma, Mantine, Daisy UI, AntDesign Editor** - Polished editor design experience

Started as a potential PR to existing projects, but the vision diverged enough to warrant building it separately.
