### Why

The existing MUI theme editors work, but they're not great to look at or use. I wanted something more minimal,visually appealing and accessible, that actually lets you build themes for both light and dark mode properly.

This isn't a ground-up rewrite — I've reused code from existing projects (shout out to the links below), but focused on improving:

- **UX:** Cleaner interface, less clutter  
- **iOS Support:** Added an iOS preset because why not  
- **Dark Mode:** Actually works properly for both light and dark themes  
- **Visual Design:** It doesn't look like shit

### Features

- Visual theme editor for MUI components  
- Material Design and iOS presets  
- Proper light/dark mode theming  
- Real-time preview  
- Theme code export  
- Built with MUI — it actually uses the components you're theming

This started as a potential PR to existing projects, but my vision differed enough that it made sense to build it separately.
